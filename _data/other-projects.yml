    My teammates and I developed Tithenai, a web-based platform designed to facilitate collaboration between scholars and undergraduate students. Tithenai serves as a common ground for publishing, sharing, and drawing inspiration from research work throughout the academic journey. As the individual responsible for frontend development in the team, I played a key role in meticulously crafting the platform using React.js and Material UI.js for visually appealing designs, ensuring a user-friendly and responsive experience across various devices, adhering to the principles of responsive web design. Node.js and Express.js on the backend, with Firebase as the database, create a robust client-server model capable of efficiently managing data and user requests. Accessible through browsers on both computers and mobile phones and available in different languages, Tithenai simplifies scientific writing and publishing, offering a unique space for undergraduates to share their work and inspire others in a distinct manner from existing scholarly social networks.

    As a part of the INF202 (Software Engineering) course at Turkish German University, this desktop application automates and simplifies the preparation of inspection result reports for inspection companies. The program manages data entries during report creation, ensuring accuracy by imposing restrictions on valid data intervals and predefined choices for streamlined information about employees, customers, equipment, and inspection results. It standardizes inspection reports, saving them as Excel files and creating printable copies in PDF format, aiming to enhance efficiency and uphold a high standard of data accuracy.
